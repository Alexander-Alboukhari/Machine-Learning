**Environmental Protection: Pollution Level Prediction**  
- **Objective:** Developed a machine learning framework to predict PM2.5 levels using past air quality and meteorological data, addressing the health risks of air pollution in urban environments.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to identify critical correlations and trends in pollution data.  
  - Evaluated and compared multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for time-series forecasting.  
  - Integrated lag features and optimized hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.  
- **Results:** Achieved high accuracy with the Random Forest model (MAE: 7.69, RMSE: 14.69) and effective temporal pattern identification using LSTM networks. Demonstrated the feasibility of integrating these models into real-time air quality monitoring systems.  
- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, NumPy, and pandas.
